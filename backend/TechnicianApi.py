# Read in mocked data from provided json file. Note that this code
# makes strict assumptions about the mock data input:
#   1. Json data contains a list of time snapshots, each with a 
#      list of three technicians. 
#   2. Snapshots are listed in ascending order.
#   3. Each technician contains a type, a properties dict, and a geometry dict. 
#   4. The properties dict contains an "id" corresponding to the snapshot id,
#      a "name" corresponding to the technician's name, a timestamp "tsecs"
#      corresponding to the current epoch seconds, and a bearing. In a given
#      snapshot, each technician has the same timestamp. 
#   5. The geometry dict contains a "type" and a "coordinates" array.
#
# Additional engineering work is required to make mock data parsing more
# flexible to support various json inputs.
